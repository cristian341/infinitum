**Welcome to the Infinitum Project, the web interface password manager.**

The name of our team is called infinitum which describes the organisation goal, sustain and to 
maintain the password manager as long possible and to pass it on  to the further generations, if 
till then all people will have the ability to memorise and remember everything they *say, see, speak.*
Till then the infinitum project will encourage the contributories from all around the world to improve <br>
the Infinitum project to make it the most powerful and unique open source, and free password manager.<br>
The infinitum project will operate under the open-source code license which will allow the users to trust <br>
in us and to report their ideas there the code could be optimised, additional they will be able to modify <br> 
the program to improve its UI and the encryption methods.
